OpenBazaar Contract Parser
========================
[Let's make trade free.](https://openbazaar.org)

+ This is a little tool I'm building to parse _raw_ JSON-formatted _OpenBazaar_ contracts.
+ **Note:** This doesn't work with the way OpenBazaar contracts are formatted at the moment. This tool works for the new contract schema currently being developed.
  + Included in the repo is a text file with an example contract that is compatible with this tool... again, see the note above.

## How to use
+ Paste the raw JSON-formatted Ricardian contract into the text area
+ Press Import
+ Contents of the contract will be reformatted into a visually pleasing presentation

## Future features
+ Validate digital signatures
+ Full set of standalone tools to be merged into repo
