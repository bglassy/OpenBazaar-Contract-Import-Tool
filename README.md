OpenBazaar Contract Parser
========================

`Basic html tool to parse OpenBazaar contracts`

+ This is a little tool I'm building to parse _raw_ JSON-formatted _OpenBazaar_ contracts.
+ **Note:** This doesn't work with the way OpenBazaar contracts are formatted at the moment. This tool works for the new contract schema currently being developed.
+ Future features:
  + Validate digital signatures

## How to use

1. Copy the raw JSON-formatted Ricardian contract from the OpenBazaar client (see note above)
2. Paste contract into the text area
3. Press Import

**Included in the repo is a text file with an example contract that is compatible with this tool... again, see the note above.**
