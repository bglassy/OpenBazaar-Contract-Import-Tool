OpenBazaar Contract Parser
========================

`Basic html tool to parse OpenBazaar contracts`

+ This is a little tool I'm building to parse _raw_ JSON-formatted _OpenBazaar_ contracts.
+ **Note:** This doesn't work with the way OpenBazaar contracts are formatted at the moment. This tool works for the new contract schema currently being developed.
+ Future features:
  + Validate digital signatures
